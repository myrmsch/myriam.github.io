abstract: The volatile digital economy forces enterprises to tap into the
potential of data-driven decision-making. Accordingly, proactive management of business processes is increasingly gaining momentum in information system research. In addition to the superior model performance of predictive models, the explainability of deep learning models
becomes a crucial requirement for real-world applications. Although recent works on explainable predictive business process monitoring propose various explainability approaches, preliminary research has been
conducted on evaluating explanations regarding their faithfulness. Since
human-created ground truth for evaluating algorithms is often unavailable or subjective, objective metrics are needed to assess the faithfulness
of explanations. We contribute to this research gap by quantitatively
and qualitatively investigating the capabilities of different explainability methods for Graph Convolutional Neural Networks in the context of
outcome prediction.
